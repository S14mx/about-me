      My name is Sergey. Currently I live in Seattle but I moved to the U.S. from Ukraine almost 9 years ago. I have a degree in Law from Ukraine but it is unfortunately not applicable here. I've worked in a bunch of different roles, mostly in customer service and logistics and my most recent job was at Comcast as a cable technician. I speak 3 languages (ukrainian, russian and english) and I have a cat named Frodo. Recently I've decided to learn programming to start a new career, so here I am :)
